# Section 29 Angular as a Platform & Closer Look at the CLI

## Angular as a Platform and Angular CLI

### Lesson 431 - Module Introduction

Apart from the Angular Framework and the code, the Angular Platform and CLI also provide useful features that can help building the application.

This module covers

- Angular Projects and Configs
- Creating and managing projects
- Schematics and Builders
- Projects, Apps and Libraries
- Etc

### Lesson 432 - A Closer Look at "ng new"

`ng new` is used for creating new Angular projects. Use `ng new --help` to view the help message that contains a list of available flags and their descriptions. More information on the Angular CLI can be found on [Angular's official documentation website](https://angular.io/cli)

Use `ng new <projectName>` to create an Angular project for this section.

### Lesson 433 - IDE & Project Setup

VSCode setups

### Lesson 434 - Understanding the Config Files

Configuration files included in the project

`.editorconfig` - File used by IDE for code styles

`browserslist` - Angular CLI will use this file to determine which browsers and their versions to build the project for production

- Each browser will have a different requirement for the generated bundle and polyfill files

`karma.conf.js` - File used for fine-tuning Unit Test configurations

`package-lock.json` - File generated by npm when installing packages from `package.json`

`package.json` - File containing scripts, dependencies and devDependencies that the npm project uses

`tsconfig.json` - Configurations for TypeScript Compiler for the project

- `angularCompilerOptions` is not for TS, but for the Angular Compiler instead
  - The Angular Compiler compiles the compiled JS (from TS compiler) and the template into instructions that can be run in the browser at runtime

`tslint.json` - Linter config for TS

`angular.json` - Covered in later lesson
