# Section 29 Angular as a Platform & Closer Look at the CLI

## Angular as a Platform and Angular CLI

### Lesson 431 - Module Introduction

Apart from the Angular Framework and the code, the Angular Platform and CLI also provide useful features that can help building the application.

This module covers

- Angular Projects and Configs
- Creating and managing projects
- Schematics and Builders
- Projects, Apps and Libraries
- Etc

### Lesson 432 - A Closer Look at "ng new"

`ng new` is used for creating new Angular projects. Use `ng new --help` to view the help message that contains a list of available flags and their descriptions. More information on the Angular CLI can be found on [Angular's official documentation website](https://angular.io/cli)

Use `ng new <projectName>` to create an Angular project for this section.

### Lesson 433 - IDE & Project Setup

VSCode setups

### Lesson 434 - Understanding the Config Files

Configuration files included in the project

`.editorconfig` - File used by IDE for code styles

`browserslist` - Angular CLI will use this file to determine which browsers and their versions to build the project for production

- Each browser will have a different requirement for the generated bundle and polyfill files

`karma.conf.js` - File used for fine-tuning Unit Test configurations

`package-lock.json` - File generated by npm when installing packages from `package.json`

`package.json` - File containing scripts, dependencies and devDependencies that the npm project uses

`tsconfig.json` - Configurations for TypeScript Compiler for the project

- `angularCompilerOptions` is not for TS, but for the Angular Compiler instead
  - The Angular Compiler compiles the compiled JS (from TS compiler) and the template into instructions that can be run in the browser at runtime

`tslint.json` - Linter config for TS

`angular.json` - Covered in later lesson

### Lesson 435 - Important CLI Commands

From within the project, there are also some important Angular CLI commands. Use `ng help` to get a list of available commands and their descriptions. All commands can be appended with `--help` to get a more detailed command for the current command.

- `ng serve` - Serve the application
- `ng generate` - Generate building blocks for the application
- `ng build` - Build the application
- `ng lint` - Use the config saved in `tslint.json` to lint through the application

### Lesson 436 - The "angular.json" File - A Closer Look

The `angular.json` contains the configurations used by the CLI for running its commands

- `newProjectRoot` - The project root to add new projects to

- `projects` - A list of projects with their names as key, and configurations as JSON object values

  - `projectType` - The type of the application, either `application` or `library`
  - `schematics` - Covered in the next lesson
  - `root` - The root folder for the project
  - `prefix` - The prefix used before all component (e.g. `app` -> `app-user`)
  - `architect` - The configurations for all different CLI commands

    - `build`, `serve`, `extract-i18n`, `test`, `lint`, `e2e`, etc

      - `builder` - The builder for building the project
      - `options` - The default options for the command that will always be included when the command is run
      - `configurations` - configurations for different environments

        - E.g. `fileReplacements` replaces the `environment.ts` file with `environment.prod.ts` file depending on the environment
        - Options specified in `configurations` overrides options specified in `options`

- `defaultProject` - The default project the CLI will run command against

  - Should be one of the project names specified in `projects`
