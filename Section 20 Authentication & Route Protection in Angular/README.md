# Section 20 Authentication & Route Protection in Angular

## Authentication

### Lesson 286 - Module Introduction

Goal: Add authentication to the Angular application so that all of or part of the application is locked down if the user is not authenticated

### Lesson 287 - How Authentication Works

Authentication logic should be stored in the server because the client JS code is exposed to the users.

To authenticate a user, the front end sends the authentication info to the server through the server's API.

For applications where client and server is coupled, the server might return a session.

However, in a decoupled application, for RESTful or GraphQL server, since they are restless, they do not store sessions since they don't care about the client app. Instead, the server generates a JWT (Javascript Web Token), which is an encoded string generated by the server using a certain algorithm with a certain key, which only the server knows.

The client will store this JWT in the local storage (browser), and attach this token whenever it makes a request. The server will check this token for validation and fail the request if the token is invalid or if the client is not authorized.

Note the client cannot attempt to generate or modify the JWT because it will not match the server's algorithm or private key, thus server can therefore determine the token is invalid and block access to the request.
