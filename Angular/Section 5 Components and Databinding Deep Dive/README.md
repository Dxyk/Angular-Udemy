## Components and Databinding

### Lesson 63 - Module Introduction

### Lesson 64 - Splitting Apps into Components

Split apps into smaller components for clarity and reusability.

### Lesson 65 - Property and Event Binding Overview

To enable communication between components, we need the following two

- Property Binding - pass data
- Event Binding - listen to event input

Property and Event Binding apply to

- HTML native elements
- Properties and events in Ng Directives (e.g. `ngStyle` and `ngClass`.)
- Custom properties and events in Components
